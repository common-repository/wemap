Wemap empowers you with smart maps to share and explore what's happening in the real world. This plugin allows you to embed a map on your website.

== Description ==

Wemap is a powerful and intuitive way to transform your content into maps that you control through the creation of powerful ‘points’, the building blocks of smart maps, in just clicks.
Mobile-UX drives Wemaps’ design and product development initiatives so you can be assured that your maps look great on any device. 
Each time you post a new article, you can create a new point for your audience - a multi-media rich(text, photos, videos, tags, date and more) point featuring your content.
You can also create and embed maps that contain multiple posts - developing guides, best of’s and to-do with your previously created content in just seconds.
Points, lists and even maps themselves are all shareable in one-click.
